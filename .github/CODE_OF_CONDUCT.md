# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

We are committed to making participation in the Materialist community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:

1. Showing empathy and kindness toward other people.
2. Being respectful of differing opinions and experiences.
3. Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
4. Taking responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes.
5. Focusing on what is best for the overall community.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

1. Sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
2. Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
3. Public or private harassment.
4. Publishing others' private information without explicit permission.
5. Other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project in public spaces. Examples include using an official email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior, report it directly to maintainers by opening a private report in GitHub Security Advisories:

<https://github.com/hspark1212/materialist/security/advisories/new>

If that path is not available, contact the repository owner directly through GitHub.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines:

1. Correction: Use for inappropriate language or minor unprofessional behavior.
2. Warning: Use for a single incident or pattern of problematic behavior.
3. Temporary Ban: Use for a serious violation or sustained behavior.
4. Permanent Ban: Use for severe harassment or abuse, or repeated violations.
